- [ ] Build Delta tables in Silver layer (typed fact and dimension tables)
- [ ] Implement transforms: Bronze → Silver (cleaning, enrichment)
- [ ] Build Gold aggregates (daily/weekly rollups, customer segments)
- [ ] Create Data Pipelines to orchestrate transforms (scheduled + event-driven)
- [ ] Build Semantic Model unifying KQL (DirectQuery) + Lakehouse (Import)
- [ ] Enable Fabric Copilot on KQL database and validate NL queries

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Silver tables match historical fact schemas from datagen
- Gold aggregates update daily via pipelines
- Semantic Model supports both real-time and historical analysis
- Copilot correctly interprets 10+ common business questions
- Data retention: KQL 14 days, Silver 1 year, Gold 3+ years

**Dependencies**:
- Phase 3 complete (queries validated)
- Bronze layer accumulating data

## Phase 5 — Actions, AI & Advanced Features (Target: Mar-Apr 2025)

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

**Deliverables**:

### Real-Time Rules & Alerts:
- [ ] Stockout detection rules with email/Teams notifications
- [ ] Reorder trigger rules with automated purchase order generation
- [ ] Truck delay alerts (>30 min past ETA)
- [ ] Sales anomaly detection (>20% deviation from forecast)
- [ ] Customer zone dwell alerts (potential service issues)

### AI & Machine Learning:
- [ ] Train demand forecasting models (7-14 day horizon per SKU)
- [ ] Deploy anomaly detection models on sales and inventory streams
- [ ] Integrate Azure OpenAI for auto-generated executive summaries
- [ ] Build recommendation scoring pipeline (next-best-product)
- [ ] Implement customer churn prediction model

### Advanced Use Cases:
- [ ] CPG supplier collaboration portal (row-level security, embedded dashboards)
- [ ] Retail media network tracking (ad revenue, impression-to-purchase)
- [ ] Dynamic pricing optimization (markdown recommendations) [NEW]
- [ ] External data integration (weather API, social sentiment feeds) [NEW]

### Copilot Enhancements:
- [ ] Natural language query refinement and suggestions
- [ ] AI-powered root cause analysis for anomalies
- [ ] Voice-activated queries (optional, mobile app integration)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 5+ alert rules deployed and firing correctly
- ML models achieving >80% accuracy on validation set
- Copilot NL success rate >70% (useful answer)
- CPG supplier portal supports 3+ user roles with different permissions
- Dynamic pricing recommendations tested in simulation mode

**Dependencies**:
- Phase 4 complete (Semantic Model, Copilot enabled)
- 60+ days historical data for model training
- Azure OpenAI Service provisioned

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Fabric capacity constraints | Start with F64, scale to F128 if needed |
| Event Hub throttling | Use partitioning, monitor metrics, request quota increase |
| ML model accuracy | Start with simple baselines, iterate with domain experts |
| Copilot limited availability | Have fallback demo flow without Copilot, prioritize Phase 5 |
| Timeline slippage | Phase 2-3 are MVP, Phase 4-5 can flex based on feedback |

---

## Resources Required

**Phase 2-3**:
- 1 Fabric engineer (full-time, 2 months)
- 1 Data analyst for queryset validation (part-time)
- Fabric capacity: F64 or F128

**Phase 4-5**:
- 1 Fabric engineer (full-time, 3 months)
- 1 Data scientist for ML models (full-time, 1.5 months)
- 1 UX designer for dashboards (part-time)
- Azure OpenAI Service quota (GPT-4)
