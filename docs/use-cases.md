# Use Cases

Based on the whitepaper and the generator’s schema, the demo focuses on:

- Real-time POS and promotions: sales/minute, tender mix, promo lift
- Inventory health: low stock, stockouts, reorder triggers, shrink signals
- Customer journey: entries, zone dwell, flows, conversion to purchase
- Supply chain: truck arrivals/departures, dwell, on-time SLAs
- Marketing attribution: impressions → visits → purchases, ROAS

Event types powering these use cases map directly to KQL tables and Lakehouse Silver/Gold aggregates.
