"""
Unit tests for marketing bug fixes in the retail data generator.

Tests verify three critical bug fixes:
1. Campaign start probability is constant at 0.90 (independent of traffic)
2. Campaigns survive zero-impression days and delete only after end_date
3. Impressions have minimum threshold (100) except when store is closed
