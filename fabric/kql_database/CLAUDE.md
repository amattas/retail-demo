# CLAUDE.md â€” KQL Database

Objectives:
- Create KQL database and connect Eventstream output
- Define tables and JSON ingest mappings aligned to datagen payloads
- Implement materialized views for core KPIs (sales, inventory, logistics)

Deliverables:
- Scripts/export of KQL DB (tables, mappings, policies) once created
- Queryset samples validating each view

Handoff:
- Coordinate with `eventstream` for field-level mapping
- Provide stable views to `dashboards` and `semantic_model`
