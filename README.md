# Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence - Retail Demo

> **⚠️ PROJECT STATUS**: This project is currently in early development. Both the data generator and Microsoft Fabric artifacts are works in progress. See [Development Status](#development-status) for details.

A comprehensive demonstration showcasing Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence capabilities for the retail and consumer products goods industry. This project combines a sophisticated data generator with Fabric artifacts to deliver actionable, real-time insights across critical retail operations.

## Overview

This demo **will illustrate** how Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence features enable retailers to make data-driven decisions at the speed of business. By combining streaming data ingestion, real-time analytics, and AI-powered insights, retailers can optimize operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive competitive advantage.

**Current Status**: The Python-based data generator is under active development. The Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence components are planned for future implementation.

## Key Scenarios (Planned)

The completed demo will showcase four critical retail scenarios powered by Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence:

### 1. Supply Chain Control Center
Monitor and optimize your supply chain in real-time:
- Live inventory tracking across warehouses and distribution centers
- Predictive stock-out alerts and automated replenishment triggers
- Real-time supplier performance monitoring
- Logistics optimization with live shipment tracking

### 2. Omni-Channel Fulfillment Visibility
Gain complete transparency across all fulfillment channels:
- Real-time order status across online, in-store, and mobile channels
- Dynamic inventory allocation and routing
- Live BOPIS (Buy Online, Pick-up In Store) performance metrics
- Same-day delivery tracking and optimization

### 3. Personalized Customer Engagement
Deliver hyper-personalized experiences powered by real-time data:
- Live customer behavior tracking and segmentation
- Real-time product recommendations
- Dynamic pricing and personalized promotions
- Instant customer sentiment analysis

### 4. AI-Driven Insights and Assistance
Leverage AI for intelligent decision-making:
- Anomaly detection in sales patterns and inventory levels
- Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
- Natural language queries against real-time data
- Automated alert generation and intelligent recommendations

## Architecture

### Data Generator
*[In Development]*

A Python-based data generator designed to produce realistic retail events including:
- **Transactional Data**: Point-of-sale transactions, online orders, returns
- **Inventory Events**: Stock movements, transfers, adjustments
- **Customer Interactions**: Browsing behavior, cart events, loyalty activities
- **Supply Chain Events**: Shipments, deliveries, supplier updates
- **Marketing Events**: Campaign interactions, promotional responses

Planned features:
- Realistic seasonal patterns and trends
- Multi-brand support with brand-specific behaviors
- Configurable data volumes and streaming rates
- RESTful API for on-demand generation
- Real-time streaming to Azure Event Hubs

### Microsoft Fabric Components
*[In Development]*

The demo will leverage the following Fabric Real-Time Intelligence capabilities:
- **Eventstreams**: Ingest and route real-time retail events
- **KQL Database**: Store and query streaming data with sub-second latency
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations for live monitoring
- **Data Activator**: Automated triggers and alerts for business events
- **AI Services**: Copilot integration for natural language insights

## Getting Started

### Current Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Azure subscription (for Event Hubs integration - optional)

### Future Prerequisites
- Microsoft Fabric workspace (required once Fabric artifacts are complete)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-demo.git
cd retail-demo

# Set up the data generator
cd datagen
pip install -e .

# Configure your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Azure credentials
```

### Running the Data Generator

**Note**: The data generator is still in development. The examples below show the planned API usage.

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server (when available)
uvicorn retail_datagen.main:app --reload

# Generate sample data via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"count": 1000, "brand": "TechStyle"}'

# Start real-time streaming
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/streaming/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stream_type": "transactions", "rate": 100}'
```
